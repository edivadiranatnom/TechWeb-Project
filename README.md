# Web technologies project

EasyRASH is a system which allows the evaluation of articles in RASH (Research Articles in Simplified HTML), integrating content and comments in a single package and facilitating the peer review process.

The project consisted in the design and implementation of a simplified version of a real peer-review system like [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/account/signin).
